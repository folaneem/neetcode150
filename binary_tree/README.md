Trees:
Binary Tree traversal: 
DFS (stack) - preorder(node, left ,right), inorder(left, right, node) and postorder(right, node, left)
BFS (level order traversal): BFS (queue) space(n) time(n)
BQDS
Binary Search Tree: Essentially, it's an ordered tree where the left node is less than the right node. time(log n) space(n)
