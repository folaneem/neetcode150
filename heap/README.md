Heap and priority queue means the same thing. Min heap (used for finding the minimum), Max heap ( used for finding the maximum)
Min heap ( parent node is always smaller than child nodes) heapify operation T O(n) S 1
Max heap (parent node is always bigger than the child nodes) heapify operation T O(n) S 1
heap is just a tree with specific property or rules

Heap is a type of binary tree that has the following properties:
- heap pop ( log n) -> to extract the minimum
- heap push ( log n) -> add an item to a heap
- heap peek -> ask what the minimum value is
- heap sort -> n log n
you can store tuples in a heap e.g (1, A) for each node
